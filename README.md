## Overview

Have you ever seen NFT collections such as <a href ="https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub">The Bored Ape Yacht Club</a> or <a href ="https://opensea.io/collection/cryptopunks">Cryptopunks</a> and wondered:
  
  ><em><h4>How these artists can mint their art so fast and so well organized without risking the quality in the process?! ü§î</h4></em> 
  
If you have, well, the short answer is by applying <a href ="https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/blog/how-python-is-used-in-automation">**Automation**</a> to their <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/standardization">**Standardized Artworks**</a>

Now, if you are wondering:
  
  ><em><h3>Oh nice! How do I do that? I'm just starting... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h3></em> 

I'm glad to introduce **SAND-wich** ü•™ to you!
  
It's an open-source software built on Python that aims to help both new and well-experienced artists in the making of NFT collections.
  
It is capable of merging any number of layers following an specific order (provided by you), and export every single result to a folder as an independent file and also a dataframe that contains the NFTs metadata used in the process.
 
By using **SAND-wich**, you are making your work more productive and organized because of the nature of applying **Automation and Standarization** to your Art. 
üóø  

  - **Technology stack**: Python 3.9.6 [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)], Pandas 1.3.1, Itertools, PIL 8.4.0.
  - **Status**:  0.1.0
  - **Executable**: https://github.com/noahverner1995/SAND-wich/blob/main/exe/SAND-wich.exe
  - **What makes this software different from others?** The ease of use and the brand concept behind it.

## Installation

**If you are a developer**, you will first have to have installed `Python 3.9.6` or later with the following dependencies: `Pandas 1.3.1` or later, `Itertools`, `PIL 8.4.0` or later. Then you can copy the code from the `SAND-wich.py` file and run it in your preferred environment.
    
**If you ARE NOT a developer**, you will first have to deactivate your Antivirus for then <a href ="https://github.com/noahverner1995/SAND-wich/blob/main/exe/SAND-wich.exe">downloading the exe file</a>. Then you can execute the program by clicking on it and pressing ‚Üµ Enter.

## Usage

First of all, you need to make sure that you already have an ***Standardized NFT Model*** made with **Adobe Photoshop**, such as this one down below:

<p align="center">
    <img src="Sample/GIF/Sample_gif.gif"/>
</p>
<p align="center"><b>Download this Standardized NFT Model</b><a  href ="https://github.com/noahverner1995/SAND-wich/blob/main/Sample/Sample.psd"> <b>HERE üëÄ</b></a></p>
<br>

Then, you open that model using **Adobe Photoshop**, then select the `Zoom` üîç tool, then move your mouse over the icon in the center of your screen, and then hold down `Left-Click` until it's big enough, then you will see something like this:

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/noahverner1995/SAND-wich/blob/main/Sample/Step%20by%20Step%20SCREENSHOTS/001.png"/>
</p>

All right, now you will create the following folders at your desired `path`:

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/noahverner1995/SAND-wich/blob/main/Sample/Step%20by%20Step%20SCREENSHOTS/002.png"/>
</p>
<p align="center"><em>Make sure to name these folders with the same</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>name of the layer groups, respectively!</em></p>
<p align="center"><em><b>#KeepItOrganized</b></em></p>
<br>

Then, you will hide all the layers in the `.psd` except one, such as `Yellow` in this case:

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/noahverner1995/SAND-wich/blob/main/Sample/Step%20by%20Step%20SCREENSHOTS/003.png"/>
</p>

Then, you will `export` as `.png`  that layer to the corresponding folder (`Background`, in this case) at the `path` you set:
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/noahverner1995/SAND-wich/blob/main/Sample/Step%20by%20Step%20SCREENSHOTS/004.png"/>
</p>
<p align="center"><em>Again, make sure to name these files with the same</em></p>
<p align="center"><em>name of the layers, respectively!</em></p>
<p align="center"><em><b>#KeepItOrganized</b></em></p>
<br>

You will repeat the previous process with every single layer, individually. Once done, you will execute `SAND-wich.exe` by selecting it with `Left-Click` and pressing ‚Üµ Enter
