## Overview

Have you ever seen NFT collections such as <a href ="https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub">The Bored Ape Yacht Club</a> or <a href ="https://opensea.io/collection/cryptopunks">Cryptopunks</a> and wondered:
  
  ><em><h4>How these artists can mint their art so fast and so well organized without risking the quality in the process?! ü§î</h4></em> 
  
If you have, well, the short answer is by applying <a href ="https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/blog/how-python-is-used-in-automation">**Automation**</a> to their <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/standardization">**Standardized Artworks**</a>

Now, if you are wondering:
  
  ><em><h3>Oh nice! How do I do that? I'm just starting... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h3></em> 
  
I'm glad to introduce **SAND-wich** ü•™ to you!
  
It's an open-source software built on Python that aims to help both new and well-experienced artists in the making of NFT collections.
  
It is capable of merging any number of layers following an specific order, and export every single result to a folder as an independent file and also a dataframe that contains the NFTs metadata used in the process.
 
By using **SAND-wich**, you are making your work more productive and organized because of the nature of applying **Automation and Standarization** to your Art.
